# Student Depression Analysis

This project is a comprehensive analysis designed to explore the factors associated with student depression. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical hypothesis testing, and predictive modeling.

## üîç Project Objectives

- Understand the underlying factors contributing to depression among students.
- Use statistical tests to validate hypotheses about academic/work pressure and depression.
- Build predictive models to classify depressed vs. non-depressed students.

## üìä Key Components

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and inconsistent labels.
- Encoded categorical variables and normalized numerical features.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized distribution of depression by gender and academic pressure.
- Explored relationships between variables using heatmaps and pair plots.

### 3. Statistical Analysis
- Conducted **t-tests** and **Mann-Whitney U tests** to assess differences between groups.
- Found significant correlations between academic pressure and depression.

### 4. Feature Engineering
- Created new composite features like **Total Pressure** to enhance predictive power.

### 5. Predictive Modeling
- Built and evaluated **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** models.
- Used confusion matrix and ROC-AUC to compare model performance.
